This tool converts formulae from one format to another. To compile it,
type 

$ ./configure
$ make

on the command line as normal user. Note that you should install PCCTS
first in source from http://www.polhode.com/pccts.html; formconv is
tested under version 1.33MR33 (please note that from gcc-3.3 you have to
modify all sources to change "#include <varargs.h>" to "#include
<stdarg.h>"). The locate utility must be also installed which is no
longer a default package from SuSE Linux 8.0; to get this software
please visit http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils (or you probably have
a precompiled version on the installation CDs or so :-). IMPORTANT:
After installing PCCTS, you should run "updatedb" before you start
"./configure". This is needed, because the configure script will not
realize that the PCCTS source is already installed.

To finalize your installation, type

# make install

as root.

To generate a hardcopy of the documentation (which is in a very starting
state yet) you also need LyX and latex2html. The documentation can be
(re)generated entering "make documentation". For more information please
visit the formconv website on http://formconv.sf.net.

In formconv currently only a few conversion types are supported, and
they are not finished yet. See HISTORY file for details.



Enjoy!
