The file overview.dia is a redrawn version of the original ../OVERVIEW.
Unfortunately there is no textual version of it currently.

PNG, SVG and EPS outputs were generated by dia. They may be obsolete
versions of the .dia file. If you encounter that, please go and
generate a new version of them (and you are encouraged to upload
the new version to the CVS ;-). (Dia v0.96.1 was used by us.)
