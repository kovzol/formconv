All libraries must be installed on your system by root
(or you must extend your paths --- probably it will not work
in some cases during the installation process). Alternatively,
you should use the wrapper script bin/formconv_runme.

Compiling dependencies are not completed yet. Sometimes a "make
distclean" is needed for creating the executables properly!
So if you want to be sure that you have a well working binary
version, make sure that you re-run "make distclean;
export CFLAGS=""; ./configure; make".

The directory structure is not too clean yet.

Documentation should be more detailed.
