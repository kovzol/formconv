Regression tests
----------------

This test suite is created for automatizing intensive testing for
formconv.

To run all tests, just enter

  ./runtests

This should run all *.in files and compare their output with the
pregenerated *.out files, respectively.

If you want to create a new test, just create a new file with .in
extension and set it executable. The output for this test can be
generated using

  ./makeregr testname.in

This will create the file testname.out.

The script "runtests" calls the script "runtest" as many times as many
*.in files exist. If there is some difference between the pregenerated
and the currently created output, then a .diff file is put down in the
./tmp directory. Ouputs for errors are shown the same place in *.err
files. You might want to use the

  ./showdiffs
  
command to view all differences.

The formconv executable should be abbreviated by $F in all tests.

Tests from the WMI2 project
---------------------------

Since 2008-04-15 till 2008-08-15 we had lots of user inputs from the
WMI2 project. We have a database of more than 47000 formulas which is a
base of our regression tests. 1% of the formulas is used for testing.
(As the formulas come from production usage, that's why some texts
contain rude words or crazy formulas.)

Tests from the MAW project
--------------------------

Between 2008-11-13 and 2008-12-13 Robert Marik collected about 3000
tests from the MAW project (functions to be integrated). 10% of
the formulas is used for testing.

Warning
-------

In general it is not a good idea to regenerate the regression tests
using a new datasource due to the changed alphabetic order of inputs.
