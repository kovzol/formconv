Version 0.8 (and above) of Formula Converter Library is written by Gabor
Bakos <baga@users.sf.net>.

Earlier versions (<=0.7.2) of formconv were mainly also his works,
however others also contributed. See obsolete/0.7.2/doc/formconv.1 for
details.

Some minor changes and documentation improvements were added
by Zoltan Kovacs <kovzol@math.u-szeged.hu>.

Extended testing contributed by Robert Vajda (version 0.7) and
Arpad Fekete (version 0.8). Robert Marik also helped to test
version 0.8.x very intensively.
